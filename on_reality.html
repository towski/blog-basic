<h3>Don't Die on Me</h3>

<p>
Life is what separates us from robots. It's also the only metrics humans
have for determining what is important. Science is great, but life is alive. 
It changes every day. Systems that are supposedly well understood are in
fact infinitely nuianced. If you have explored the world, then
you have seen this. Perhaps one day the internet will one day provide the rich
experience that only life can, but for now we are psychologically dependant
on experiences real life course through our veins. We can always change
quicker than the forces that might trap us, so stay one step ahead.
</p>

<p>
So for now you have one goal in life. And that is to find things that are
alive. It is the only place for opportunities. For joy. As a human,
you cannot feel joy while surrounded by dead things. And merely being
a human does not make you alive. 2 years ago, I was beginning to feel surrounded by
robots. The people I knew seemed to be trapped in a preprogrammed sequence. 
The only way to break out was to force my way into a new environment.
</p>

<p>
I decided when I was younger that I wasn't going to turn my head away from the 
incredibly vivid.
I was no longer comfortable contemplating the beautiful but mechanical
world of entertainment, and that the real world had more entertainment value.
I came to ignore anyone that was encouraging me to not think. 
I sought out places that are informationally dense. And preferably
before they are strip mined for information and homogoneized and assimilated. 
</p>

<p>
There are some places where you won't see anything interesting in an entire day.
And then there are places where even a lifetime of exploration would
just be a drop in the bucket. 
You can tell when a tourist trap is just a facade. A testament
to something that is already dead. I am looking for living systems. 
It's like a drug to experience the world deeply. To realize that a lot
of it is redundant, or phony. You have to really dig to find if something
actually important is going on, or if people are just getting drunk.
</p>

<p>
Love is probably the most emotionally and informationally dense high you
can get. If you find the next unexploited place, you will find the 
opportunities you are looking for. That twinge of mystery. The contented
strangers. Human society is like a national park. There is a rush to
find and explore the great parts, but also to preserve them. Don't break
other peoples hearts, or they will become damaged. But of course, people
don't follow that rule for various reasons, and so there a huge number
of spent individuals. For your job, or for you life. You need to find
the opportunity. It is the difference between what is living, and what is dead. 
</p>

<p>
I don't know how to tell you that you're wrong, but no matter what, you haven't
been everywhere and seen everything. And information you'll find on the internet
is often. Living things change every day. You have to see them up close to 
really understand them. 
</p>

<p>
I can report that this is certainly a mixed blessing. It can be somewhat suicidal to
submit yourself to the true force of reality. Because the world can a hostile
and terrible place. I do see the value of hiding behind a huge wall and a pile
of money, shutting yourself in and submitting to Netflix and Skyrim.  I have been
called old fashioned for being personally devoted to this lifestyle. Sometimes
finding people who share my perspective can be few and far between. Often times
people are not even curious to corroborate data. 
</p>

<p>
I've also paid a terrible price for wanting to see and understand everything personally. 
I have aged. I have scars. I have spent hours and hours contemplating if it's really worth
it. After all, hasn't the internet made knowing things personally obsolete? 
I do get a deep satisfaction from personally understanding
the world as fully as is possible. I began to realize that no amount of abstraction
or imagery would ever fully do the world justice
</p>

<p>
It's impossible to fully communicate the beauty of sitting in a public square in
Old San Juan. No amount of hand waving and photographs will take you there.
The sublimeness of actually being there. 
You cannot tell if you will actually like a place just from the brochure. 
That's the wonder of fantasy. You need to personally categorize the living and the dead.
</p>

<p>
I'm only 30, but I feel like the human equivalent of a blown speaker. I can never
go back to a fantasy world. Yet, as a human being, I feel like you are capable of
at least understanding how sublime . It's discouraging how thoroughly uncurious
people can be. It can be deeply painful. You will start to get bored talking
to people who have never pushed themselves, and yet who are impolite.
</p>

<p>
Live everywhere, but you may not like what you see. When you experience the world
more fully, The Wired world cannot offer you the depth of experience that you get. Just as
television or movies can't truly offer you the feeling of being there. They
always leave out steps. And it's these steps that are important for truly understanding.
</p>

<p>
My recommendations are to live all over the world, but choose places that you know nothing about.
Explore them. Don't take Anthony Bourdain's word as fact. We can only ever scratch the surface
of the gigantic human reality. Form your own opinions about places and people. Because only
then will you truly understand.  Documentaries can be very engaging. 
Especially when they don't tell you what you should be thinking.
