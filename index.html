Even when the world around you assaults you at every turn, perhaps you can find some solace in these 
words. A conversation we are having across space and time. The mind still needs a single coherent
explanation of the world, to reassure us. That someone somewhere knows something about what
they've seen. Someone took an interest. Someone else has seen the worst. And the best.

One day the youths of the world will clamber out of their Pokemon induced trance and want to
know what really happened. How things really are. Perhaps it's only a lucky few that actually
peek behind the curtain and watch the actors bicker. To me that's
the more interesting part of life. Not what people say but what they do.
How do they really feel. A facade is a lie that you get caught believing.
Be it now or later.
